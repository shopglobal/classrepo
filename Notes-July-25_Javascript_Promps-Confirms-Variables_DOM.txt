Javascript basic variables:

Strings have = "The Strings";
Numbers have = 7;
Booleans have = true/false;

Example in class notes: 

Var name = "Snow White";
var dwarfCount = 7;
var isSleeping = true;



Full working prompt/alerts/confirms example(s):
    <script type="text/javascript">

    alert("Let's talk about Sushi for a minute. . .");

    // Notice that the confirm and prompt take in variables but the alert doesn't
    var doYouEatSushi = confirm("Do you like Sushi?");
    var whatTypeSushi = prompt("What type of Sushi do you like ?");

    // Alert the results
    alert(doYouEatSushi); 
    alert(whatTypeSushi);

    if     	(doYouEatSushi) {

    	alert ("Awesomesauce  " +  whatTypeSushi);    
    }
    else {
    	alert ("Have another look at the menu.");
    }
    // Write code here!

    </script>


DOM is Document Object Model:

<script type="text/javascript">

document.write("We're the greatest coders on earth.");

</script>
