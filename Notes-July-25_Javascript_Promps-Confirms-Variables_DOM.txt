Javascript basic variables:

Strings have = "The Strings";
Numbers have = 7;
Booleans have = true/false;

Confirm: True or False, Yes or No, Ok or Cancel
Prompt: Write text strint or number answer and store to the reference

Confirm/Prompt/Alert: Boolean
Confirm/Prompt/Alert: Strings & Numbers

Example from scratch:
var rainNow = confirm("Is it raining now?")
var weatherLike = prompt("What's the weather like, over by your house?")

    alert("Hello, my name is " + name )
    alert("Is your Home Town a Big City" + isABigCity);

      console.log("Hello, my name is " + name );
      console.log("Is your Home Town a Big City" + isABigCity);
      console.log("age , homeTown, isABigCity");
      // console.log(age, homeTown, isABigCity); //




Example from class notes: 

Var name = "Snow White";
var dwarfCount = 7;
var isSleeping = true;



Full working prompt/alerts/confirms example(s):
    <script type="text/javascript">

    alert("Let's talk about Sushi for a minute. . .");

    // Notice that the confirm and prompt take in variables but the alert doesn't
    var doYouEatSushi = confirm("Do you like Sushi?");
    var whatTypeSushi = prompt("What type of Sushi do you like ?");

    // Alert the results
    alert(doYouEatSushi); 
    alert(whatTypeSushi);

    if     	(doYouEatSushi) {

    	alert ("Awesomesauce  " +  whatTypeSushi);    
    }
    else {
    	alert ("Have another look at the menu.");
    }
    // Write code here!

    </script>
